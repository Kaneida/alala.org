					During our last visit in May 2012 to the 40 orphaned children in Andhra Pradesh, India we bought a stock of food which will last them for 3 months. We also bought an air conditioning system. Additionally, we viewed some land as we are aiming to build an orphanage for those children who are currently living in very cramped conditions.
